# The Ripple Effect of Interest Rates: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the impact of the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) on key economic indicators, including the S&P 500, inflation (CPI), consumer spending (PCE), and unemployment rates. Using historical data and visualizations, the analysis uncovers patterns and relationships that define economic cycles.

## Dataset Sources
The analysis is based on the following datasets:
- **DFF.xlsx** - Federal Funds Rate
- **s_and_p_500_data.csv** - S&P 500 Closing Prices
- **CPIAUCSL.xlsx** - Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- **PCEPI.xlsx** - Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)
- **UNRATE.xlsx** - Unemployment Rate

## Key Findings
- **Stock Market**: S&P 500 generally rises with lower interest rates but declines when rates increase.
- **Inflation**: Higher interest rates slow inflation growth, but the effect takes time.
- **Consumer Spending**: PCE dips during high-rate periods, as borrowing becomes costlier.
- **Unemployment**: Unemployment rises after rate hikes due to economic slowdowns.

## Visualizations
The project generates multiple plots comparing the Federal Funds Rate to each economic indicator, revealing key economic trends and cycles.
